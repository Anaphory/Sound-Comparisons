 - Transform database/Language to be usable with Mustache
 - Push master

2014-04-30:
 - The search all translations feature is currently implemented as nonsense.
   I should change this.

2014-04-24:
 - Simple TranslationProviders don't care for their study at the moment,
   but I've got the impression that they should.

2014-03-11:
 - When switching to do more via .js:
   - I want to orientate on the JSON syntax for languages/families that robert uses under http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/atla1278.json
   - The whole data of glottolog is to be found under https://github.com/clld/glottolog-data and shall help me derive the layout for the json
   - I'll need some kind of presentation for words, I think
   - This is the chance to keep the map from zooming in many times
   - Also the map should remember it's location when switching words
   - We can also proxy to other clld sites, so that the .js can do happy/wild things
 - Make sure views are recreated when another Study is added
   - It appears that this was one of the problems encountered with Romance
   - Make sure we've got better error reporting here.
 - Superscripts after Transcriptions appear to be buggy (look at Slavic)

2014-03-06:
 - Tried site performance with hhvm-nightly.
   apach2+php: Times (min, avg, max): 2.0196, 3.0096589473684, 5.4663
   hhvm:       Times (min, avg, max): 0.7163, 2.7047795918367, 6.4519
   It appears that hhvm is a better choice than php,
   but the database still makes for much slowdown.
 - Prepared statements offer inherent problems with dynamic tables.
   This is sad, because I'd like to use them.
 - With the stopwatch I found out,
   that about 3.4s (< 50%) are used on sorting words for
   http://127.0.0.1/shk/main/?study=Mapudungun&languages=Huilliche%20%28Lagos%29&pageView=languageView&hl=en&wo_order=alphabetical&wo_phLang=Ancestral%20Mapudungun
   If I could use a view to sort words,
   or some other, smart method,
   this could increase performance by a leap.

2014-02-27:
 - Ask Paul which fields he'd like to be in .csv exports.

2014-02-20:
 - Make filtering in wordlist faster if possible

2014-02-13:
 - Up to ~1.6s are spent on a call of Study:getWords,
   which means, that up to ~3s of site generation could be spent this way.
   Look at http://127.0.0.1/shk/main/?study=Mapudungun&languages=Huilliche%20%28Lagos%29&pageView=languageView&hl=en&wo_order=alphabetical&wo_phLang=Ancestral%20Mapudungun
   - It just took 8.2493s to generate.
 - export/csv.php is the last pice to use database/Transcription:getNotCognates,
   it could be cleaned up, if csv.php was rewritten.
 - Show lexeme numbers >1 as subscripts for Transcriptions and Words
 - Contributors on page for translations would be nice
   - But we need a way of building this

2013-11-12:
 - Build the Website as a dynamic .js application,
   so that many changes happen faster.
   Try to share templates between the App and the Serverside,
   so that php can still generate pages.

2013-11-07:
 - Allow html or something thelike for about pages
 - Add in a home button (before 'view by')
   - Build something to allow for paul to add content

2013-09-11:
 - It appears in mapview, that if 'my selection' equals 'all languages',
   the buttons to change between them are pretty useless.

2013-08-01:
 - Introduce seperate cells for items that have different variants with subscript
   - in 1w,1l and probably even lw and wl views
 - Later on:
   - Use Chromium Developer Tools -> Audit to streamline .css
     - Leverage this to get rid of style.css, because we've got main.css now
   - Refine database/Language.php:getDescription
     - Also think about the way it's included in the Tabulator.php:languageHeadline

From myself:
 - IsHtml field can be removed from v4.Page_StaticTranslation
   - This will need adjustment in different places

Using 'My Selection' in mapView removes all languages from the map
  where it should switch to the last selection

The Language Set collapse/expand box doesn't behave correctly.
 - It deletes selected languages somehow, and I don't know where/how o.O
 - Maybe it does so in Init functions of the PageViewâ€¦

Storing of mySelection in Mapview and in TopMenu between views
 - this can be incorporated once the main site runs with .js

-- Long term notes:
 - Think about a smaller/faster/better vm client os than XUbuntu
   - This way Paul would have a nicer time working with it
   - This could already use github to pull stuff from
   - I should base this on debian testing/stable
