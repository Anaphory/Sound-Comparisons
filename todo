 - Can we remove parts of the language table that are translated?

2014-07-03:
 - Maybe we can get rid of the admin/query/migrate script and the providers' migrate methods?

 - Once we've got an equal to the ValueManager in JavaScript,
   something that might also build on top of the PageWatcher,
   we want this thing to log the events that the PageWatcher currently does,
   because there is information hidden to the PageWatcher.

 - Simple TranslationProviders don't care for their study at the moment,
   but I've got the impression that they should.

2014-02-13:
 - Show lexeme numbers >1 as subscripts for Transcriptions and Words
 - Contributors on page for translations would be nice

2013-11-07:
 - Allow html or something thelike for about pages
 - Add in a home button (before 'view by')
   - Build something to allow for paul to add content

2013-08-01:
 - Use Chromium Developer Tools -> Audit to streamline .css
   - Leverage this to get rid of style.css, because we've got main.css now

From myself:
 - IsHtml field can be removed from v4.Page_StaticTranslation
   - This will need adjustment in different places
