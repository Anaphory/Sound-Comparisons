 - In Multitable:
   - Words in their cells to the left, maybe
   - Cross to the top right
   - No line breaks between languages and their superscripts
 - Playbacks that don't have a pronounciation seem to block the playqueue in mapvie in mapvieww
 - Use colors for RegionGroups just like for Families in the Andean Study, when viewing MultiTables
 - github.com/clld
   - We'd like to use their format, but we don't wanna loose our special presentation features.
   - This is to be kept in mind as an interesting thing.
 - In MultitableTransposed, counting for languages is off by one when no words are shown

2013-09-19:
 - Break up Tabulator.php into template like parts that can easily be included
 - Learn about Zotero
 - Let map remember location when switching words

2013-09-13:
 - Move 'view by' with tabs in topmenu to the middle.
   - This is no easy task (thinking of smaller screens and the hell of horizontal alignment)

2013-09-12:
 - Placement of WordOverlay.js in MapView
   still appears to be buggy.
   I believe this to be caused by wrong bboxes.

2013-09-11:
 - It appears in mapview, that if 'my selection' equals 'all languages',
   the buttons to change between them are pretty useless.

2013-09-06:
 - Rewrite .htaccess file(s)

2013-08-01:
 - Introduce seperate cells for items that have different variants with subscript
   - in 1w,1l and probably even lw and wl views
 - Later on:
   - Use Chromium Developer Tools -> Audit to streamline .css
     - Leverage this to get rid of style.css, because we've got main.css now
   - Refine database/Language.php:getDescription
     - Also think about the way it's included in the Tabulator.php:languageHeadline
   - Need script for landing with /<Study> or /<Translation> like fonetika.org/Andean or fonetika.org/es (spanish translation)
   - Think about building a script that finds all unused SoundFiles and all supposed SoundFiles that don't exist

2013-07-18:
 - Wordslist to be prettier and use lexemes
 - Note that genscript.php must also be aware of .wav files,
   which means that it'll become more generic soon.
 - Fix tables under Consonants Other in ipaKeyboard.
   - Almost done

2013-07-11:
 - Change the way that Words/Phonetics are displayed on the page depending on lexemes

From Polina:
 - Add save buttons directly next to dt inputs
   -> This will need some more rewriting
   -> Maybe extend search to achieve this?

From myself:
 - IsHtml field can be removed from v4.Page_StaticTranslation
   - This will need adjustment in different places

in IPA Keyboard: Consonants-Main (Plumonic) with grid in the table

Center +- for LanguageSets and MeaningSets horizontally

Using 'My Selection' in mapView removes all languages from the map
  where it should switch to the last selection

Füge spezielle Fehlerseiten hinzu.

The Language Set collapse/expand box doesn't behave correctly.
 - It deletes selected languages somehow, and I don't know where/how o.O
 - Maybe it does so in Init functions of the PageView…

Storing of mySelection in Mapview and in TopMenu between views
 - this will need a good solution
 - Keep word between wordview and mapview

-- Long term notes:
 - Think about splitting off all queries into the database dir, so that it's easier to grasp them all.
   - Introduce a general dbaccess class that handles all issues not handled by any of the other classes.
     This will also come in handy once another db with a different layout is included.
 - Comment / Document more.
 - Think about a smaller/faster/better vm client os than XUbuntu
   - This way Paul (Maybe also Scott?) would have a nicer time working with it
   - This could already use github to pull stuff from
   - I should base this on debian testing/stable
