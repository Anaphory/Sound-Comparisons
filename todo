 - Let translator identify by browsermatch,
   maybe also change it's parameter to be hl like google has it.

2014-02-05:
 - Fix slavic, http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/sndcomp/?study=Slavic&pageView=mapView&translator=1&wo_order=alphabetical throws invalid WordId.

2014-02-02:
 - The new Translation doesn't hide some elements in Basic Input when they're not necessary.

2014-01-31:
 - Map items appear to loose their position when moving the map

2013-12-11:
 - In Selection for SpellingLanguages, the selectionbox is to far to the right
 - Zooming in on the map when changing stuff is annoying, Paul wants it gone.
   - Check if the MapView can start zoomed in, or build it all with Backbone.
 - Fix translations for words via clever script that awaits construction
   - Check what is actually broken
 - Copy new translations for Mapudungun over in admin interface

2013-11-26:
 - Had a look at the program normalize-audio,
   which might be helpful to normalize the recordings in the sound directory

2013-11-12:
 - Build the Website as a dynamic .js application,
   so that many changes happen faster.
   Try to share templates between the App and the Serverside,
   so that php can still generate pages.
 - MapView in Mapudungun for Blood has Next and Prev Links identical.
   This also appears to be a problem with different other words (and studies?)

2013-11-07:
 - Minifications breaks .js, due to incorrect order of some .js files
 - Allow html or something thelike of about pages
 - Add in a home button (before 'view by')
   - Build something to allow for paul to add content

2013-10-04:
 - github.com/clld
   - We'd like to use their format, but we don't wanna loose our special presentation features.
   - This is to be kept in mind as an interesting thing.

2013-09-19:
 - Learn about Zotero
 - Let map remember location when switching words
   - This already implies building a bigger part of the site
     as a .js application.

2013-09-13:
 - Move 'view by' with tabs in topmenu to the middle.
   - This is no easy task (thinking of smaller screens and the hell of horizontal alignment)
   - I could try and do this with .js, but that wouldn't be a nice solution.

2013-09-11:
 - It appears in mapview, that if 'my selection' equals 'all languages',
   the buttons to change between them are pretty useless.

2013-08-01:
 - Introduce seperate cells for items that have different variants with subscript
   - in 1w,1l and probably even lw and wl views
 - Later on:
   - Use Chromium Developer Tools -> Audit to streamline .css
     - Leverage this to get rid of style.css, because we've got main.css now
   - Refine database/Language.php:getDescription
     - Also think about the way it's included in the Tabulator.php:languageHeadline
   - Need script for landing with /<Study> or /<Translation> like fonetika.org/Andean or fonetika.org/es (spanish translation)

2013-07-18:
 - Wordslist to be prettier and use lexemes
 - Note that genscript.php must also be aware of .wav files,
   which means that it'll become more generic soon.
 - Fix tables under Consonants Other in ipaKeyboard.
   - Almost done

From myself:
 - IsHtml field can be removed from v4.Page_StaticTranslation
   - This will need adjustment in different places

in IPA Keyboard: Consonants-Main (Plumonic) with grid in the table

Center +- for LanguageSets and MeaningSets horizontally

Using 'My Selection' in mapView removes all languages from the map
  where it should switch to the last selection

Füge spezielle Fehlerseiten hinzu.

The Language Set collapse/expand box doesn't behave correctly.
 - It deletes selected languages somehow, and I don't know where/how o.O
 - Maybe it does so in Init functions of the PageView…

Storing of mySelection in Mapview and in TopMenu between views
 - this will need a good solution
 - Keep word between wordview and mapview

-- Long term notes:
 - Think about splitting off all queries into the database dir, so that it's easier to grasp them all.
   - Introduce a general dbaccess class that handles all issues not handled by any of the other classes.
     This will also come in handy once another db with a different layout is included.
 - Think about a smaller/faster/better vm client os than XUbuntu
   - This way Paul (Maybe also Scott?) would have a nicer time working with it
   - This could already use github to pull stuff from
   - I should base this on debian testing/stable
