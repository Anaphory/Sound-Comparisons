 - Adjust map height depending on screen via .js
   - At the moment the map height is set statically,
     I believe, and we're wasing space when the page is zoomed or thelike.
 - Move 'view by' with tabs in topmenu to the middle.
 - For side menus, remove padding to the top,
   so that the headlines are closer to the top and
   more or less on the same height as the hideLinks.
 - Make sure HideLinks don't overlap with text when collapsing
 - When collapsing right hidelink, it causes a horizontal scrollbar to appear
   in the browser. Seen in MapView this behaviour suggests,
   that some elements like to take up more space than they should
 - Rearrange Sound buttons:
   - In 1W view let it hover over the left top edge
     of the table, and put the map icon like a superscript behind the headline
   - In MapView build something like the controlpanel into the map so that
     we have the play buttons there like nice controls.
 - When words have indices _1 and _2, their respective sounds lack the _1 one, but have _2 displayed.
 - Remove unnecessary spacing between map an headline, aswell as between headline and table in 1W view.
 - Distribute todays work as an update.

2013-09-12:
 - Placement of WordOverlay.js in MapView
   still appears to be buggy.
   I believe this to be caused by wrong bboxes.

2013-09-11:
 - It appears in mapview, that if 'my selection' equals 'all languages',
   the buttons to change between them are pretty useless.

2013-09-06:
 - Rewrite .htaccess file(s)
   - I need to hide the architecture…

2013-08-01:
 - Introduce seperate cells for items that have different variants with subscript
   - in 1w,1l and probably even lw and wl views
 - Later on:
   - Use Chromium Developer Tools -> Audit to streamline .css
     - Leverage this to get rid of style.css, because we've got main.css now
   - Refine database/Language.php:getDescription
     - Also think about the way it's included in the Tabulator.php:languageHeadline
   - Need script for landing with /<Study> or /<Translation> like fonetika.org/Andean or fonetika.org/es (spanish translation)
   - Think about building a script that finds all unused SoundFiles and all supposed SoundFiles that don't exist

2013-07-22:
 - Spread the use of new db functions from DBTable to other files in database/
   - Split Language.php into parts to make it easier to maintain and ready it for lexemes and contributors

2013-07-18:
 - Wordslist to be prettier and use lexemes
 - Shift the playbutton to the left, and add contributor information to the right for 1l view.
 - Note that genscript.php must also be aware of .wav files,
   which means that it'll become more generic soon.
 - Fix tables under Consonants Other in ipaKeyboard.
   - Almost done

2013-07-11:
 - Change the way that Words/Phonetics are displayed on the page depending on lexemes
   - Build projections to handle the database, build views to display it's parts

From Polina:
 - Add save buttons directly next to dt inputs
   -> This will need some more rewriting
   -> Maybe extend search to achieve this?
 - Languages, RegionLangues have duplicate entries… -.-

From myself:
 - Current mysql functions are deprecated, I should migrate to new ones, it appears.
   Found on http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-fetch-row.php
 - IsHtml field can be removed from v4.Page_StaticTranslation
   - This will need adjustment in different places

in IPA Keyboard: Consonants-Main (Plumonic) with grid in the table

More space to the sides of the singleLanguageTable

Center +- for LanguageSets and MeaningSets horizontally

Using 'My Selection' in mapView removes all languages from the map
  where it should switch to the last selection

Füge spezielle Fehlerseiten hinzu.

The Language Set collapse/expand box doesn't behave correctly.
 - It deletes selected languages somehow, and I don't know where/how o.O
 - Maybe it does so in Init functions of the PageView…

Storing of mySelection in Mapview and in TopMenu between views
 - this will need a good solution
 - Keep word between wordview and mapview

Produce a soundfile generation script,
  that will help building the missing soundfiles.

-- Long term notes:
 - Think about splitting off all queries into the database dir, so that it's easier to grasp them all.
   - Introduce a general dbaccess class that handles all issues not handled by any of the other classes.
     This will also come in handy once another db with a different layout is included.
 - Comment / Document more.
 - Think about a smaller/faster/better vm client os than XUbuntu
