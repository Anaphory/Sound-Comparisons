 - The italian translation is missing?

2014-07-04:
 - Can we remove parts of the language table that are translated?

2014-07-03:
 - HideButtons for SideMenues appear to break the page layout
   - Map and 1L view for example
 - Display study that a translation originates from along with the search results
   - Remember the case of Knochen/Bein in Germanic vs. Knochen in the rest of studies.
 - Maybe we can get rid of the admin/query/migrate script and the providers' migrate methods?

2014-06-10:
 - Once we've got an equal to the ValueManager in JavaScript,
   something that might also build on top of the PageWatcher,
   we want this thing to log the events that the PageWatcher currently does,
   because there is information hidden to the PageWatcher.

2014-06-06:
 - Different .js parts can now be adjusted to the new LinkInterceptor/PartView style
   - This concerns parts that draw information from the first load,
     like soundPlays, or MapView aswell as URL parsing.

2014-04-30:
 - The search all translations feature is currently implemented as nonsense.
   I should change this.

2014-04-24:
 - Simple TranslationProviders don't care for their study at the moment,
   but I've got the impression that they should.

2014-02-13:
 - Show lexeme numbers >1 as subscripts for Transcriptions and Words
 - Contributors on page for translations would be nice
   - But we need a way of building this

2013-11-07:
 - Allow html or something thelike for about pages
 - Add in a home button (before 'view by')
   - Build something to allow for paul to add content

2013-09-11:
 - It appears in mapview, that if 'my selection' equals 'all languages',
   the buttons to change between them are pretty useless.

2013-08-01:
 - Introduce seperate cells for items that have different variants with subscript
   - in 1w,1l and probably even lw and wl views
 - Later on:
   - Use Chromium Developer Tools -> Audit to streamline .css
     - Leverage this to get rid of style.css, because we've got main.css now

From myself:
 - IsHtml field can be removed from v4.Page_StaticTranslation
   - This will need adjustment in different places
