 - Can we remove parts of the language table that are translated?

2014-07-03:
 - October is a deadline for when we want the site to run without bugs
 - HideButtons for SideMenues appear to break the page layout
   - Map and 1L view for example
 - A function to search/find missing translations that need to be filled in
 - Display study that a translation originates from along with the search results
   - Remember the case of Knochen/Bein in Germanic vs. Knochen in the rest of studies.
 - Maybe we can get rid of the admin/query/migrate script and the providers' migrate methods?

2014-07-02:
 - Push out a new update, to supply Scott, Hans-JÃ¶rg and Paul with new, working versions of the site.
   - Remember the dump.

2014-06-10:
 - Once we've got an equal to the ValueManager in JavaScript,
   something that might also build on top of the PageWatcher,
   we want this thing to log the events that the PageWatcher currently does,
   because there is information hidden to the PageWatcher.

2014-06-06:
 - Different .js parts can now be adjusted to the new LinkInterceptor/PartView style
   - This concerns parts that draw information from the first load,
     like soundPlays, or MapView aswell as URL parsing.

2014-04-30:
 - The search all translations feature is currently implemented as nonsense.
   I should change this.

2014-04-24:
 - Simple TranslationProviders don't care for their study at the moment,
   but I've got the impression that they should.

 - When switching to do more via .js:
   - I want to orientate on the JSON syntax for languages/families that robert uses under http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/atla1278.json
   - The whole data of glottolog is to be found under https://github.com/clld/glottolog-data and shall help me derive the layout for the json
   - I'll need some kind of presentation for words, I think
   - This is the chance to keep the map from zooming in many times
   - Also the map should remember it's location when switching words
   - We can also proxy to other clld sites, so that the .js can do happy/wild things
 - Superscripts after Transcriptions appear to be buggy (look at Slavic)

2014-02-27:
 - Ask Paul which fields he'd like to have in .csv exports.

2014-02-13:
 - export/csv.php is the last pice to use database/Transcription:getNotCognates,
   it could be cleaned up, if csv.php was rewritten.
 - Show lexeme numbers >1 as subscripts for Transcriptions and Words
 - Contributors on page for translations would be nice
   - But we need a way of building this

2013-11-07:
 - Allow html or something thelike for about pages
 - Add in a home button (before 'view by')
   - Build something to allow for paul to add content

2013-09-11:
 - It appears in mapview, that if 'my selection' equals 'all languages',
   the buttons to change between them are pretty useless.

2013-08-01:
 - Introduce seperate cells for items that have different variants with subscript
   - in 1w,1l and probably even lw and wl views
 - Later on:
   - Use Chromium Developer Tools -> Audit to streamline .css
     - Leverage this to get rid of style.css, because we've got main.css now

From myself:
 - IsHtml field can be removed from v4.Page_StaticTranslation
   - This will need adjustment in different places
