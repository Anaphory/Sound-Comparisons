 - Filter out IsOrthographyHasNoTranscriptions in MultiMenues.
 - Check if multitables in Andean are build correctly
 - Remove wrongly placed x icons in multiview in top right edge of browser window
 - SpellingLanguages should not be on the Map or in the Phonetic Filter
   - And not on the map.
 - Build the 'Who are we' page.
 - Adjust height offset of click/hover option button
 - Contributors: Have small avatars with names as hover text linking to their paragraphs on the who are we page in longterm

2013-08-01:
 - From Polina:
   - In Slavic study: no entries in Leftmenu have Hovertext / Hovertext is always identical to text
     - An example would be 'Russian: St. Pete'
     - The cause appears to be, that the fields RegionGpMemberLgNameShortInThisSubFamilyWebsit, RegionGpMemberLgNameLongInThisSubFamilyWebsite
       are empty
     - Notified Paul of these empty entries
 - Introduce seperate cells for items that have different variants with subscript
   - in 1w,1l and probably even lw and wl views
 - Add a special site for Contributors
 - Later on:
   - Use Chromium Developer Tools -> Audit to streamline .css
     - Leverage this to get rid of style.css, because we've got main.css now
   - Refine database/Language.php:getDescription
     - Also think about the way it's included in the Tabulator.php:languageHeadline
   - Need script for landing with /<Study> or /<Translation> like fonetika.org/Andean or fonetika.org/es (spanish translation)
   - Think about building a script that finds all unused SoundFiles and all supposed SoundFiles that don't exist

2013-07-22:
 - Spread the use of new db functions from DBTable to other files in database/
   - Split Language.php into parts to make it easier to maintain and ready it for lexemes and contributors
 - Migrate translations before deploying an update
   - Remember that I introduced some new static translations
     These will have to be readded after executing the import script.

2013-07-18:
 - Wordslist to be prettier and use lexemes
 - Shift the playbutton to the left, and add contributor information to the right for 1l view.
 - Note that genscript.php must also be aware of .wav files,
   which means that it'll become more generic soon.
 - Fix tables under Consonants Other in ipaKeyboard.
   - Almost done

2013-07-11:
 - Change the way that Words/Phonetics are displayed on the page depending on lexemes
   - Build projections to handle the database, build views to display it's parts

From myself:
 - Viewing Andean in Germanic translation poses the problem that no words can be displayed o.O
 - I think I lost the German Translations for Words
   -> Also: The alternative translations that come with words for the given spelling language in a study

From Polina:
 - Add save buttons directly next to dt inputs
   -> This will need some more rewriting
   -> Maybe extend search to achieve this?
 - Translation via search
  -> Description, Match, Original, Translation
 - Languages, RegionLangues have duplicate entries… -.-

From myself:
 - Current mysql functions are deprecated, I should migrate to new ones, it appears.
   Found on http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-fetch-row.php
   - I'd like some 'projections' to deal with herpaDerp
 - IsHtml field can be removed from v4.Page_StaticTranslation
   - This will need adjustment in different places
 - Maybe it would be nice to rewrite some .js for translation with backbone,
   but it's not necessary right now.

in IPA Keyboard: Consonants-Main (Plumonic) with grid in the table

More space to the sides of the singleLanguageTable

Center +- for LanguageSets and MeaningSets horizontally

Using 'My Selection' in mapView removes all languages from the map
  where it should switch to the last selection

Füge spezielle Fehlerseiten hinzu.

The Language Set collapse/expand box doesn't behave correctly.
 - It deletes selected languages somehow, and I don't know where/how o.O
 - Maybe it does so in Init functions of the PageView…

Storing of mySelection in Mapview and in TopMenu between views
 - this will need a good solution
 - Keep word between wordview and mapview

Produce a soundfile generation script,
  that will help building the missing soundfiles.

-- Long term notes:
 - Think about splitting off all queries into the database dir, so that it's easier to grasp them all.
   - Introduce a general dbaccess class that handles all issues not handled by any of the other classes.
     This will also come in handy once another db with a different layout is included.
 - Comment / Document more.
 - Think about a smaller/faster/better vm client os than XUbuntu
